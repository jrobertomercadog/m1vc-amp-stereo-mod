# m1vc-amp-stereo-mod
A simple mod that allows M1VC NeoGeo obtain stereo sound from the IC lines and amplify it properly. Based on the OMVS design by tianfeng33.

*This is not my original design!* I re-traced the audio section of the original PCB to use larger (and more handy) components for DIY users.

The expert and master-mind behind the original design is the amazing tianfeng33.

Notes about the uploaded BOM:

*For Resistors:* Whichever brand you want as long as they are: SMD, 1206 footprint, 1/4w and 1% tolerance.

*For Capacitors:* Whichever brand you want as long as they are: SMD, rated 10v minimum and 1206 footprint.

The PCB design was exported from EasyEDA.
