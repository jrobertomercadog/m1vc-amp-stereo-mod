# m1vc-amp-stereo-mod
A simple mod that allows the NeoGeo M1VC to obtain stereo sound from the IC lines and amplify it properly. Based on the OMVS design by tianfeng33.

*This is not my original design!* I re-traced the audio section of the original PCB to use larger (and more handy) components for DIY users.

The expert and master-mind behind the original design is the amazing tianfeng33.

Notes about the uploaded BOM:

*For Resistors:* Whichever brand you want as long as they are: SMD, 1206 footprint, 1/4w and 1% tolerance.

*For MLCC Capacitors:* Whichever brand you want as long as they are: SMD, rated 10v minimum and 1206 footprint.

*For TANTALUM Capacitors:* Whichever brand you want as long as they are: C12 is CASE D, C16 and C17 are CASE B. All must have polarity, rated for 10v or more. 1 Ohm ESR or less.
 
The PCB design was created and exported from EasyEDA.
