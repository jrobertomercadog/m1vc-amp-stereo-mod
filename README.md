# m1vc-amp-stereo-mod
A simple mod that allows M1VC NeoGeo obtain stereo sound from the IC lines and amplify it properly. Based on the OMVS design by tianfeng33.
*This is not my original design!* I re-traced the audio section of the original PCB to use larger (and more handy) components for DIY users.
The expert and master-mind behind the original design is the amazing tianfeng33.
